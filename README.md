# GIS Routing with Leaflet and Python

Welcome to our GIS Routing project! This project showcases routing functionality using Leaflet maps and Python, enabling you to visualize routes between multiple locations on an interactive map.

## Features
- Interactive Maps: Utilize Leaflet maps to visualize routes, waypoints, and locations.
- Custom Markers: Designate start and end points with custom marker icons.
- Routing Functionality: Calculate and display optimal routes between locations.
- Waypoints Support: Incorporate multiple waypoints for complex route planning.
- HTML Export: Generate HTML files for easy sharing and integration into web applications.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language for route calculation and map generation.
- Folium: Python library for creating Leaflet maps.
- Leaflet: JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies for map visualization and customization.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GIS-Routing-Leaflet-Python.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd GIS-Routing-Leaflet-Python
   ```
4. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Modify the coordinates and waypoints in `main.py` to fit your routing needs.
2. Run the Python script to generate the routing map:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Open the generated `routing_map.html` file in your web browser to view the routing map.

Feel free to explore and customize the code to suit your specific GIS routing requirements!
